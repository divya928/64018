#In the third question, the goal programming model was formulated as a linear programming (LP) model in R and solved to determine the optimal production quantities. 
#The objective function was defined to maximize total profit, with penalty terms incorporated for deviations from the employment and earnings goals. Constraints were added to represent the employment and earnings goals. Non-negativity constraints were imposed on the deviation variables.
#The lpSolve package was used to solve the resulting LP model. The optimal solution was found to be:
#- x1 = 10
#- x2 = 10 
#- x3 = 10
#The employment goal is achieved exactly and earnings goal is exceeded. No negative devations needed.
#With these production quantities, the maximum total profit is $270 million.
#The employment goal is achieved exactly at the target of 70 units. The earnings goal is exceeded, with earnings reaching $80 million (based on the unit contributions). Therefore, no negative deviations are required.
#In conclusion, the goal programming model provides an optimal production plan that maximizes profit while satisfying the employment goal exactly and exceeding the earnings target. This aligns well with management's aims to maximize profit, maintain a stable workforce, and achieve an increase in earnings. The model effectively balances the different goals and provides useful insights for decision-making. Goal programming is an effective technique for this type of multi-objective optimization problem.

#Additonally, we mentioned the need to create a text file in the lp format for the Weigelt problem formulation. This is a standard way to represent linear programming and goal programming problems for various solvers. We can write the problem in the lp format, specifying the objective function, constraints, and variable bounds.
