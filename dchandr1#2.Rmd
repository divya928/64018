```{r}
#THEREFORE, IT GAVE US THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF SIZE PRODUCTS THAT HAS TO BE MADE ON EACH PRODUCTION PLANT
get.variables(lppoint)

```{r}
#THEREFORE, WE CAN SAY THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF PLANT'S EXCESS CAPACITY TO PRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS IN THREE SIZES(LARGE, MEDIUM AND SMALL) ON EACH PLANT (PLANT1, PLANT2, PLANT3) SHOULD USE 92.59% OF ITS CAPACITY
##FROM ABOVE OUTPUT, WE CAN SAY THAT EACH PLANT SHOULD PROUDUCE,
### 516.6667 OF LARGE PRODUCTS AND 177.778 OF MEDIUM PRODUCTS IN PLANT1
### 666.6667 OF MEDIUM PRODUCTS AND 166.6667 OF SMALL PRODUCTS IN PLANT2
### AND, 416.6667 OF SMALL PRODUCTS IN PLANT3
